- 👋 Hi, I’m @NicoDNico
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Js(web development shit)/Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me learn im a dumb F.
- 📫 How to reach me: yell "yoo" loud enough.
-  I keep my github private cause im kinda ashamed of my progress, but you can see im always traying to code when i have pc in front of me. 

Yeah im prob being cringe but i already know im bad at coding and learn slow, at this point im just looking  to see if make someone laugh enough to get couch money.
